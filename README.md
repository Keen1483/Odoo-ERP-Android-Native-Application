## Odoo ERP Mobile

Odoo ERP mobile is a native Android application developed in Java.
It is a Webview application that allows to use all Odoo modules.
It is not linked to a specific Odoo application. 
When you start the application, you just enter the server address and the port used.
Whether your server is local or remote, the application will work the same way.

## APK

I added a directory that contains the debug and release apk.
You can install them and test them on any Odoo application.

## Development tools

This application was developed with Java 8 on AndroidStudio 3.5
